A News Letter created with React 18 and bootstraped with React Prime. The News are served from a Mongo/Node/Express app using Socket.Io

The objective is to create a prototype of app which provides information about News to users.

The aplication has two views: New News and Archived News.
- New News View
<img src="./frontend/media/pt1.jpg" alt="new news" width="300"/>

- Archived News
<img src="./frontend/media/pt2.jpg" alt="archived news" width="300"/>

The two frontend views consume all his data from the Socket server endpoints as we see in the frontend documentation. The server has a several endpoints dont used by the fronted like the Create article.

In this proptotype we use postman to test the endpoints:

- Emiters from clientSide//Listeners from serverSide
client:findNewNews
client:findArchivedNews
client:archiveArticle
client:deleteArticle

- Listeners from clientSide//Emiters from serverSide
server:findNewNews
server:findArchivedNews
server:createError
server:archiveError
server:deleteError
